* Protected user passwords by hashing with the *bcrypt* package.
* Set up the groundwork for user authentication.
* Performed raw SQL queries using Sequelize literals.

***Module 14 skills learned:***
* Organize a codebase following the MVC paradigm.
* Create templates with Handlebars.js to reduce the amount of front-end JavaScript needed.
* Implement built-in and custom helpers in Handlebars.js to help with formatting.
* Store and use data saved on a back-end session.
* Write your own middleware functions for Express.js.
